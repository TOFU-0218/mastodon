    "readme": "# Open Collective postinstall\n\nLightweight npm postinstall message to invite people to donate to your collective\n\n## Installation\n\n```\nnpm install --save opencollective-postinstall\n```\n\nAnd in your `package.json` add:\n\n```json\n{\n  ...\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"postinstall\": \"opencollective-postinstall\"\n  },\n  \"collective\": {\n    \"url\": \"https://opencollective.com/webpack\"\n  }\n  ...\n}\n```\n\n## Disabling this message\n\nIn some places (e.g. CI) you may want to disable this output. You can do this by setting the environment variable `DISABLE_OPENCOLLECTIVE=true`.\n\nIt will not be shown if npm's log level is set to silent (`--silent`), warn (`--quiet`), or error (`--loglevel error`).\n\nNote: This is a lightweight alternative to the [opencollective-cli](https://github.com/opencollective/opencollective-cli) that offers a more complete postinstall message with the current balance and ASCII logo of the collective.\n",
