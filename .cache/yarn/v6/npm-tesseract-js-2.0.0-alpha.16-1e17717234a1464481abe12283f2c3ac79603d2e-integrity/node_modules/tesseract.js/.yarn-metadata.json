([Demo](http://tesseract.projectnaptha.com/))\n\n[![fancy demo gif](./docs/images/demo.gif)](http://tesseract.projectnaptha.com)\n\nTesseract.js wraps an [emscripten](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten) [port](https://github.com/naptha/tesseract.js-core) of the [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) [OCR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition) Engine.\nIt works in the browser using [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) or plain script tags with a [CDN](#CDN) and on the server with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).\nAfter you [install it](#installation), using it is as simple as:\n\n```javascript\nimport { TesseractWorker } from 'tesseract.js';\nconst worker = new TesseractWorker();\n\nworker.recognize(myImage)\n  .progress(progress => {\n    console.log('progress', progress);\n  }).then(result => {\n    console.log('result', result);\n  });\n```\n\n[Check out the docs](#docs) for a full explanation of the API.\n\n\n## Major changes in v2\n- Upgrade to tesseract v4\n- Support multiple languages at the same time, eg: eng+chi_tra for English and Traditional Chinese\n- Supported image formats: png, jpg, bmp, pbm\n- Support WebAssembly (fallback to ASM.js when browser doesn't support)\n\n\n## Installation\nTesseract.js works with a `<script>` tag via local copy or CDN, with webpack via `npm` and on Node.js with `npm/yarn`.\n\n\n### CDN\n```html\n<!-- v2 -->\n<script src='https://unpkg.com/tesseract.js@v2.0.0-alpha.16/dist/tesseract.min.js'></script>\n\n<!-- v1 -->\n<script src='https://unpkg.com/tesseract.js@1.0.19/src/index.js'></script>\n```\nAfter including the script the `Tesseract` variable will be globally available.\n\n\n### Node.js\n\n**Tesseract.js currently requires Node.js v6.8.0 or higher**\n\n```shell\n# For v2\nnpm install tesseract.js@next\nyarn add tesseract.js@next\n\n# For v1\nnpm install tesseract.js\nyarn add tesseract.js\n```\n\n\n## Documentation\n\n* [Examples](./docs/examples.md)\n* [Image Format](./docs/image-format.md)\n* [API](./docs/api.md)\n* [Local Installation](./docs/local-installation.md)\n* [FAQ](./docs/faq.md)\n\n\n## Contributing\n\n### Development\nTo run a development copy of Tesseract.js do the following:\n```shell\n# First we clone the repository\ngit clone https://github.com/naptha/tesseract.js.git\ncd tesseract.js\n\n# Then we install the dependencies\nnpm install\n\n# And finally we start the development server\nnpm start\n```\n\nThe development server will be available at http://localhost:3000/examples/browser/demo.html in your favorite browser.\nIt will automatically rebuild `tesseract.dev.js` and `worker.min.js` when you change files in the src folder.\n\nYou can also run the development server in Gitpod ( a free online IDE and dev environment for GitHub that will automate your dev setup ) with a single click.\n\n[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/naptha/tesseract.js/blob/master/examples/browser/demo.html)\n\n### Building Static Files\nTo build the compiled static files just execute the following:\n```shell\nnpm run build\n```\nThis will output the files into the `dist` directory.\n\n## Contributors\n\n### Code Contributors\n\nThis project exists thanks to all the people who contribute.
