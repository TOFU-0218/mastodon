    "readme": "substring-trie\n====\n\nMinimalistic trie implementation for prefix searches. It finds the longest string from the dictionary that matches the beginning of the input string, or `undefined` if no matching string can be found.\n\n    npm install substring-trie\n\n```js\nvar Trie = require('substring-trie');\n\nvar trie = new Trie(['banana', 'grape', 'grapefruit'])\n\ntrie.search('banana'); // 'banana'\ntrie.search('banan'); // undefined\ntrie.search('bananas'); // 'banana'\ntrie.search('grape'); // 'grape'\ntrie.search('grapefruit'); // 'grapefruit'\ntrie.search('grapefruit and other fruit'); // 'grapefruit'\n```\n\nNote this is not designed for autosuggestions. Instead this is designed as a replacement for regex-based prefix searching:\n\n```js\nvar regex = /^(banana|grapefruit|grape)/\n\n'banana'.match(regex); // ['banana']\n'banan'.match(regex); // null\n'bananas'.match(regex); // ['banana']\n'grape'.match(regex); // ['grapefruit']\n'grapefruit'.match(regex); // ['grapefruit']\n'grapefruit and other fruit'.match(regex); // ['grapefruit']\n```\n",
